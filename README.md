Evaluating Perceived Stress and Stroke Prevalence – does perceived stress alone have a statistically significant impact on the likelihood of having a stroke?


Mental health has always played a significant role in our overall health and well-being. However, only in recent decades has mental health been studied and researched to explore relationships between mental and physical health. According to the World Stroke Organization, stroke is the second leading cause of death worldwide (What We Do, n.d.). While the existing literature is limited, studies have begun to unveil associations between mental health conditions and stroke outcomes (Surtees et al., 2008). The growing awareness of the relationship between physical and mental health, partnered with the existing prevalence of stroke, implies that stones are still left unturned in stroke research.


Leveraging existing literature and a Stroke Prediction Dataset, an analysis was carried out on participants who lie in a “healthy” physical state while also considering the perceived stress of each participant.
